          <h4 class="mainarticle">When many people think about smartwatch games, the first thing they imagine are tamagotchi-style virtual pets jabbering away on your wrist looking for your attention all day.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">Happily, the real potential of these devices for gaming is more interesting, and less annoying. Even if it may not seem like this in the early days.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">When many people think about smartwatch games, the first thing they imagine are tamagotchi-style virtual pets jabbering away on your wrist looking for your attention all day.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">“When smartphones first came out, we saw a lot of companies try and take popular social games from Facebook and other platforms and sloppily port them to smartphones, resulting in some pretty bad games,” says Harlan Crystal, chief technology officer at publisher Pocket Gems, which has just launched an Apple Watch app for its War Dragons game.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">“It’s possible that a similar process will happen from smartphones to smartwatches. For a game to be truly great, it has to be built from the ground up for the platform that it’s on. If someone tries to simply shrink a popular smartphone game so people can play it on their wrist, it’s probably not going to be a great experience.”</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">“Games can’t be built in the same way that console, PC or even mobile games have been,” agrees Paul Virapen, chief executive of wearable games startup WearGa, which had a hit on the Pebble smartwatch with its Pixel Miner game, and has just released Cupcake Dungeon for the Apple Watch.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">“Apple Watch features like fully customisable long-look notifications can be incredibly powerful for games. The difference between a simple text-based notification and a full-screen animated notification, which looks and feels like the game, is huge,” he continues.</h4>

          <h3 class="articlehead">Games in ‘a hundred five-second sessions a day’</h3>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">Developers talk a lot about play patterns on smartwatches, and particularly the fact that people won’t be squinting at their wrists for long gaming sessions. Or even medium-length ones for that matter..</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">Virapen talks about “games for playing in a hundred five-second sessions a day” for example, while Petri Järvilehto, chief creative officer for Best Fiends developer Seriously, talks about games existing “in your peripheral vision” throughout the day.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">“We saw games go from high-intensity and highly demanding console experiences into much more accessible and ‘always available’ mobile games, and saw games finally break into the mainstream,” he says.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">“I believe that next we’ll see a similar [change over time] from mobile games to ultra-casual games that anyone can enjoy in short glances. While a lot of the smartwatch gaming discussion focuses around short sessions, this can go even further and translate into the game being present on some level through your entire day.”</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">Bossa Studios, whose smartphone games include Surgeon Simulator, Thomas Was Alone and Twelve a Dozen, has developed a new game for the Apple Watch called Spy_Watch, which puts people in charge of their own virtual espionage agency.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">“If we average out play patterns for phone games, you would typically be making a decision to interact with a game every few hours and engaging for a few minutes,” says chief operating officer Vince Farquharson.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">“When we started to design Spy_Watch, the one thing we knew for definite was that these play patterns would not work on the watch, as this is not how people use them and it’s not how that device has been designed. The watch is a device that you’re typically going to be looking at every 20-30 minutes for a few seconds.”</h4>

          <h3 class="articlehead">Smarter notifications for players to take action</h3>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">In other cases, smartwatches will be used mainly for checking in on progress in existing social games, and perhaps quickly tapping on a notification to take action accordingly.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">Crystal talks about Pocket Gems’ War Dragons, where players can see when their guild has declared war on another guild, and thus decide whether to join the fray. He adds that games with changeable economies could also update players to ensure they don’t miss a good deal.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">“I think the most exciting thing is enabling a limited, but more personal interaction space where you can prompt a player to perform a quick action without intruding as much,” says David Marsh, co-founder of developer NimbleBit, whose Letterpad word game can be played on Apple Watch.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">“It’s a lot easier to get a buzz on your wrist and choose an action than to get a notification on your phone, take it out of your pocket, unlock it, and load the app the notification came from.”</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">Notifications are one of the most interesting smartwatch features for games developers, especially when they enable players to take actions rather than simply decide whether to pull out their smartphone.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">Javier Ferreira, chief operative officer of Scopely, explains that its Yahtzee With Buddies game has a chat notification for Apple Watch that players can read and respond to using voice dictation or simply an emoji, before continuing with whatever they were doing.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">Bossa Studios’ Vince Farquharson adds that smart notifications were a “eureka moment” for Spy_Watch. “This opened up a whole new avenue for the game as it allowed us to really double down on the idea that you were actually communicating with an agent in the field with your Spy_Watch, as we could handle his messages and your interactions in the same way as messages from your friends,” he says.

          <h4 class="mainarticle">“We always described the experience internally as being like one of your friends you were chatting with was a spy and you’d communicate with him in exactly the same way you would with your real friends.”</h4>
    

          <h3 class="articlehead">Smarter notifications for players to take action</h3>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">Is there a danger of notifications overload? It’s already an issue on smartphones, where games seem to be one of the most aggressive kinds of apps in terms of pinging their players at regular intervals – whether it’s an in-game event or a plea to return to an abandoned title.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">This, surely, could be even more intrusive on a smartwatch than on a smartphone? “If developers just spam players to come and play without any context, it’s going to be intrusive wherever they’re seeing it. That’s a design issue, not a platform issue,” says Crystal.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">“If someone uses notifications too intrusively, then people will just toggle them off,” says Järvilehto, who expects there to be a learning curve for developers, as they figure out what players will and won’t stand for on their smartwatches.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">“It’s better to start from creating a compelling experience and letting the player choose instead of trying to push things to the player,” he says.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">NimbleBit’s Marsh thinks that the glanceable nature of smartwatches will reduce any annoyance for players, compared to smartphones that (if allowed) will buzz in your pocket identically for every new notification.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">“Just being able to tell at a glance that the notification you got was from a game and deciding to take action on it or not without stopping what you are doing is a pretty big upgrade,” he says. “So I think it will make notifications even less intrusive.”</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">“The watch is all about context. Notification and glances can become a key component of user interaction on the watch as long as they fit into the user context. Make them relevant at the right time and right place and they won’t be intrusive,” adds Itamar Lesuisse, chief executive of brain-training apps firm Peak.</h4>

That’s a design issue, not a platform issue,” says Crystal.</h4>

          <h3 class="articlehead">The importance of simplicity (especially for battery life)</h3>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">It’s an obvious thing to note that, as with other devices, the current crop of smartwatch platforms are starting off relatively restricted in terms of how developers can access the native hardware and software, but are likely to open up over time.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">Even so, games developers are aware of the limitations – particularly with the current Apple Watch software development kit (SDK). “A lot of developers don’t realise how limited the SDK is. You can’t really do much with it, although you can show stuff,” says Adrian Hon, chief executive of fitness games startup Six to Start.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">“The more exciting stuff is going to come when we have more control of the hardware: I think Apple is going to do a native SDK later this year. I’m amazed it’s happening that quickly to be honest.”</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">He adds that he understands Apple’s motives. “If you were to run something complex on an Apple Watch, you’re going to kill the battery, and that’s going to be a bad experience.”</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">Many developers relish creative restrictions, of course. “The initial WatchKit SDK is a little limited, particularly when you look at it from a game development point of view. Some things you take for granted when developing games, like moving sprites around the screen, aren’t fully supported yet,” says WearGa’s Virapen.</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">“It’s actually been brilliant for us. These kind of limitations gave some structure to the design process and led to some really exciting decisions.”</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">“I think it’s fine to have such a limited SDK at first, especially before people even have access to the hardware,” says Marsh. “I can’t imagine how many buggy and broken apps there would be if developers were able to dig very deep on the platform without actually having hardware to test on.”</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">Farquharson admits to being “bemused” at criticism of SDK limitations at this stage, suggesting that a richer, native SDK for a device like the Apple Watch might encourage more developers to simply squash down their smartphone games</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">“You are going to hit your head against a brick wall if you see the watch as a small phone on your wrist, it simply isn’t, and if you try and make a phone game for it then you are going to constantly find you’re swimming against the tide,” he says</h4>

          <h4 class="mainarticle">The alternative: working within the limitations to make something new and fitting for the platform. “Having gone through that process you end up with something which feels very different to a game designed for a phone and that’s exactly why we find it so exciting.”</h4>
